Memory Management
-->Two types of Memory Management:
a)Manual Memory Management
b)Garbage collector

Manual Memory Management:
    C language is the best example for manual memory mamgemnt.
    In C,developers needs to aloocate and deallocate the memory by themselves which leads to
    dangling pointers and memory issue.
    It is hard for the beginner to understand the memory management in C.So the learning curve is high.

Garbage Collector:
Example:Java,Java Script.
    In these type of languages,Developers need not to worry about manual memory management because
        language itself written in a such a way that it cleans the memory or data which is out of scope.
    Garbage Collector runs periodically to delete the unused data from RAM.

Here Comes the Rust Way of dealing with Memory Management:
    Rust has the unique way of dealing with memory managemnt.
    It has some unique concepts called ownership and Borrowing which makes rust memory safe.
    RUst checks all the memory issues at compile time.


Mutability:
    In every language there are tow types of variables which can be changed  
        and which are unchanged once after declaring.
    In rust,by default all the variables are immutable but can we can still use 
        the mut keyword to make them mutable.
    This mutability concept ensures to run the program more fast because as we already saying the compilier 
        that values can be changed or not so that multiple threads can acces the data sta the same time.
